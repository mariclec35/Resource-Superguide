# Resource Project

A structured recovery resource management system designed to improve clarity, accessibility, and organization within outpatient treatment programs and recovery communities.

---

## Overview

Resource Project standardizes how recovery resources are organized, maintained, and accessed.

It provides:

- A curated database of vetted recovery resources  
- Structured categorization and filtering  
- Administrative management capabilities  
- Search functionality  
- A scalable system architecture  

The current focus is building a reliable Core Resource Guide.

## Problem

Many outpatient programs rely on:

- Static PDF lists  
- Inconsistent formatting  
- Manual updates  
- Limited administrative control  

This creates friction, inconsistency, and difficulty maintaining accurate information.

Resource Project introduces structured data management and centralized oversight to improve reliability and clarity.
